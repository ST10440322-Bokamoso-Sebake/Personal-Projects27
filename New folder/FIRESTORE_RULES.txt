service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /tasks/{taskId} {
      // Users can only read/write their own tasks
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      // Users can create tasks with their own userId
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
